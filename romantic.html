                    <p> Karma (Laura) is a woman in her thirties. She works as a teleoperator in a department
                     store and shares a flat with her friend Roberto. They are a galactic duo and work 
                     better than any conventional marriage. Karma’s life turns 180 degrees when she meets 
                     Leo, her Tinder match. Leo ends all her fears and makes her feel like a goddess in 
                     bed and out of it. However, she coexists with the monsters of her past, with the 
                     burden of weighing more than society accepts as normative, with the need to return 
                     to therapy and with the belief of having a self-esteem that in reality is not as iron 
                     as she thinks.</p>

                    Rain and Jack hate each other. Rain and Jack belong to different planets.
                    Rain and Jack can’t have less in common. And yet they keep crossing each other.
                    Over and over again. First in high school, then in a concert and, unexpectedly,
                    also a few years later, when they already believed that they would not meet 
                    again. They are even pushed to share a night in a lost house in the middle 
                    of the forest. Rain thinks there’s no such thing as chance. Jack, causalities 
                    don’t explain everything. They both want to be right. And they both know 
                    they’re wrong.

                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  Sparks jump when a figure skater and the hockey team captain are forced to share
                    a track and get much closer than they would like. Anastasia Allen is determined 
                    to enter the US Olympic figure skating team and, when she gets a scholarship to
                     the University of California, everything seems to go according to her plan.
                    Nathan Hawkins' goal as hockey team captain is to keep his boys on the ice at all 
                    costs, but everything gets complicated when they have to share a track with a 
                    beautiful and very bad-tempered skater. The situation forces these rivals to spend 
                    time together, but Anastasia is calm. You know perfectly well that a hockey player 
                    could never distract you, let alone Nate... right?
