                    <h4>The daughter of the pirate king</h4>
                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  Do not run the risk of belittling Alosa: she is the daughter of the Pirate King, and 
                    when she proposes something, she succeeds. So when your father assigns you an important 
                    mission, you won’t have the slightest qualms about manipulating, lying, and stepping 
                    on top of whoever it takes to accomplish it. And if to achieve your goal you must get 
                    caught by Riden, a pirate with a very bad reputation, you will. Because Alosa is 
                    convinced that Riden is no match for him... until he begins to see that he is much more 
                    cunning than he thought. And he also finds it unexpectedly attractive... Soon the tension 
                    between them becomes a storm of feelings in which neither of them wants to sink. Because
                     when two pirates meet, there is only one possible way out: one of them must be shipwrecked.

                    <h4>The wide world: the glorious years</h4>
                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p> The wide world recounts the adventures, misadventures, adventures and secrets of the Pelletiers, a 
                    family that owns a soap factory in Beirut, a city under French influence, with the Indochina War
                    and post-war Paris and reconstruction as a backdrop. And all with a touch of exoticism and several 
                    murders. Lemaitre tells us three love stories, two processions, the story of Buddha and Confucius,
                    the adventures of an ambitious journalist, a tragic death, the life of the cat Joseph, the mistreatment
                    of an unbearable wife, the corruption of governments, a descent into hell... A masterly novel, 
                    luminous and dark at the same time, tender and hard, full of turns, captivating, that plays 
                    deliciously with the codes of the brochure.
