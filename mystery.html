                    <h4>You will reap storms</h4>
                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  On a cold November night, Guido Brunetti receives a call from his colleague, ispettore Vianello, 
                    alerting him that a hand has been seen on one of Venice’s canals. The body is soon found and 
                    Brunetti is assigned to investigate the murder of this undocumented immigrant. Since there is no 
                    official record of the man’s presence in Venice, he is forced to use much more succulent sources 
                    of information in the city: gossip and memories of people who knew the victim. Interestingly, he 
                    had been living in a small house on the grounds of a palazzo owned by a university professor, in 
                    which Brunetti discovers books that reveal the victim’s interest in Buddhism, the revolutionary 
                    Tamil Tigers and the latest crop of Italian political terrorists, active in the 1980s. As research 
                    expands, Brunetti, Vianello, Commissioner Griffoni and signorina Elettra gather pieces of a puzzle 
                    that seem to have little in common, until Brunetti stumbles upon something that transports him to his 
                    time as a student and makes him reflect on the lost ideals and mistakes of youth.

                    New York, 2017. Cora Merlo, a first-year resident, suffers a sudden heart attack that forces her to
                    undergo a heart transplant. Still convalescing, the young woman is visited by a strange woman with 
                    an enigmatic offer: to spend a few days in Steelville, a small inland town, to learn about the life
                    of her son Charles, the donor of her heart. Cora thus enters a home full of secrets, in a mystery 
                    that extends for twenty years and in a hermetic town in which, just the day of his arrival, a baby

                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  It is night and in the port of Barcelona a guard makes his round when his German shepherd stops dry 
                    to sniff desperately a container. Upon arrival, the mossos d'esquadra find inside a woman in a fetal 
                    position, unconscious and dehydrated. She has a gap in her temple, burns on her face and body, and 
                    she doesn’t remember who she is or what her mother tongue is, but she’s alive. While recovering at 
                    Hospital Clínic, a man attempts to kill her. Inspector Anna Ripoll, an expert on trafficking in women, 
                    seems to have found her identity and address: Alicia Garone; 19, rue du Chariot, Lyon. In the French 
                    city, Inspector Erik Zapori is looking for a way to get rid of the investigation to which internal 
                    affairs is subjecting him for corruption and pimping. Nothing better than traveling to Spain to help 
                    solve a case, although this may be the most complex of his life.

                    <h4>Age of Vice</h4>
                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  This is the age of vice, where money, pleasure, and power are everything,and the family ties that bind 
                    can also kill.New Delhi, 3 a.m. A speeding Mercedes jumps the curb and in the blink of an eye, five 
                    people are dead. It’s a rich man’s car, but when the dust settles there is no rich man at all, just a 
                    shell-shocked servant who cannot explain the strange series of events that led to this crime. Nor can 
                    he foresee the dark drama that is about to unfold.Deftly shifting through time and perspective in 
                    contemporary India, Age of Vice is an epic, action-packed story propelled by the seductive wealth, startling 
                    corruption, and bloodthirsty violence of the Wadia family — loved by some, loathed by others, feared by all.
                    In the shadow of lavish estates, extravagant parties, predatory business deals and calculated political 
                    influence, three lives become dangerously intertwined: Ajay is the watchful servant, born into poverty, who 
                    rises through the family’s ranks. Sunny is the playboy heir who dreams of outshining his father, whatever the 
                    cost. And Neda is the curious journalist caught between morality and desire. Against a sweeping plot fueled by 
                    loss, pleasure, greed, yearning, violence and revenge, will these characters’ connections become a path to 
                    escape, or a trigger of further destruction?

                    <h4>Murder your employer</h4>
                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  A devilish thriller with a killer concept: The McMasters Conservatory for the Applied Arts, a luxurious, 
                    clandestine college dedicated to the fine art of murder where earnest students study how best to “delete” 
                    their most deserving victim. Who hasn’t wondered for a split second what the world would be like if a 
                    person who is the object of your affliction ceased to exist? But then you’ve probably never heard of The 
                    McMasters Conservatory, dedicated to the consummate execution of the homicidal arts. To gain admission, a 
                    student must have an ethical reason for erasing someone who deeply deserves a fate no worse (nor better) 
                    than death. The campus of this “Poison Ivy League” college—its location unknown to even those who study 
                    there—is where you might find yourself the practice target of a classmate…and where one’s mandatory graduation
                    thesis is getting away with the perfect murder of someone whose death will make the world a much better 
                    place to live.
