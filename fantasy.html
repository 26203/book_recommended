                    <h4>The stolen legacy</h4>
                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  It’s been eight years since the Battle of the Serpent, but in the frozen north, Lady Nore
                     of the Court of Teeth has recovered the Ice Needle Citadel. There he employs an ancient 
                     relic to create monsters made of sticks and snow that will follow his orders and execute 
                     his revenge. Suren, the child queen of the Court of Teeth, and the only person with power 
                     over her mother, fled to the human world, where she now lives like an animal in the woods. 
                     Alone and still afflicted by the merciless torments she endured at court, she devotes her 
                     time to freeing mortals from reckless dealings. She thinks everyone has forgotten her, until 
                     Bogdana, the witch of the storm, chases her one night through the streets. The person who 
                     saves her is none other than Prince Oak, heir to Elfhame, to whom she was once betrothed and 
                     to whom she has held a grudge for years. At seventeen, Oak is charming, beautiful and 
                     manipulative. He has undertaken a mission that will lead him north and wants Suren’s help.
                     However, if she accepts, it will mean exposing her heart to the boy she once knew, who has 
                     become a prince she does not trust, while facing all the horrors she thought she had left behind.

                    <h4>Let us forge silver stars</h4>
                    <h5>Synopsis:</h5>
                    <p>  Magic has been forbidden in Syhl Shallow since best friends Jax and Callyn remember. They used to 
                    love stories about powerful magic makers and mythical scravers that conjured fire or controlled ice, 
                    but now they’ve learned that magic is nothing but dangerous; it’s what killed Callyn’s parents and 
                    left her in the care of her little sister. Magic has never helped Jax, who lost his foot in an accident
                     for which his father has not stopped punishing him. Magic won’t save either of you when the tax 
                     collector knocks on your door.<br>
                    Jax and Callyn are shocked to discover that a magic maker has returned to Syhl Shallow and that he has
                    married the new queen. The people are now expected to simply accept the presence of dangerous magic in 
                    their environment and nobody likes the idea.<br>
                    When a stranger arrives in town and offers Jax and Callyn money in exchange for delivering secret messages
                    for an anti-Magic faction, the choice is obvious, even if it means they may be helping plot to destroy their 
                    new king. It’s a risk they’re willing to take. Until another visitor arrives in town: the handsome Lord Tycho, 
                    messenger of the king, the man charged with discovering who is plotting against the throne.

                    <p>   Every spring, Ithaca condemns twelve girls to the noose. It is the price that the vengeful Poseidon demands 
                    for the lives of the twelve maidens of Queen Penelope who, centuries ago, were hanged and cast into the depths.
                    But when fate comes to Leto, death turns out not to be what she expected. After his murder, he wakes up on a 
                    mysterious island where he meets a green-eyed girl with the power to rule the seas. Her name is Melanto, she 
                    is sweet, mysterious and precious... and she says that, to end Poseidon’s curse, Leto must assassinate the 
                    prince of Ithaca. Despite the danger, she is more than willing to fulfill her mission. Unfortunately, 
                    Prince Matthias is much harder to hate than Leto and Melanto had hoped...
